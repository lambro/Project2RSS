~~~~ RSS - FEED.me - APP ~~~~

This is an app that was created in a pair during week 8 of the General Assembly Web Development Intensive Course. 

In order to pull the articles / entries from the RSS feeds you have to run the rake task first.
This app uses gems including 'Feedjira' and 'Carrierwave'.

This project was created to display up to date articles / entries using RSS, giving the user the ability to bookmark articles and subscribe to feeds. The user needs to log in before accessing the content, and can up load a picture to their user account.

~~~~ Installation ~~~~~

Run bundle, 'rake db:seed', and 'rake db:migrate' to kick things off, then to populate the entries run the rake task:

namespace :rss do
  desc "updating feed at set intervals"
  task :update_feeds => :environment do
    Feed.all.each { |a| Article.update_from_feed(a.url, a.id)}
  end
end
